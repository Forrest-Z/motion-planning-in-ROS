\subsection*{Overview}

This project is in progress.

Brief Package Descriptions\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily roadmap}\+: A package with tools to generate various types of graph structured Road Maps. Currently, it supports P\+R\+Ms and Grids
\end{DoxyItemize}

Planned additions\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Global Planning using Theta$\ast$, D$\ast$ Lite, Potential Fields
\item Local Planning with D\+WA and M\+PC
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{How to use\+:}

\subsubsection*{Probabilistic Road Maps}

To generate a P\+RM launch {\ttfamily view\+\_\+prm.\+launch}. This will create a new P\+RM and visualize it in Rviz.

Change the parameters in {\ttfamily config/map\+\_\+params.\+yaml} to customize the components of the map.

The following image was taken using a cell size of 0.\+2m with a buffer radius of 0.\+15m. The graph consists of 500 nodes trying to connect to the 10 nearest neighbors. 

\subsubsection*{Grids}

To generate a grid, launch {\ttfamily view\+\_\+grid.\+launch}. This will create a new grid and visualize it in Rviz.

Change the parameters in {\ttfamily config/map\+\_\+params.\+yaml} to customize the components of the map.

The following image was taken using a cell size of 0.\+2m with a buffer radius of 0.\+15m. The grid has a 5 times finer resolution than the provided map, with black cells as the actual obstacle, gray cells representing cells inside the buffer zone, and white representing the free space.
